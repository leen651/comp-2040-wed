# Text Statistics Program

This is a simple Python program that reads a file called `input.txt`, analyzes the text, and gives you:

- How many words there are
- How many unique words
- How many characters (with and without spaces)
- Average word length
- The most common word(s)

The results are printed on the screen and also saved to `output.txt`.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

Put your text in a file named `input.txt`.

Then run:

```bash
python main.py
